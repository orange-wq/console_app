This project is a console-based application designed to manage a bank's customer database. It provides functionality to add, remove, view client information, and perform specific tasks.

The program creates two classes: Bank, which stores information about bank clients (account number, passport details, account category, current balance, and date), and depositor, which manages an array of Bank objects.

Key features of the application include:

Loading and Saving Data: the ability to load data from a binary file and save client information into it.
Adding and Removing Clients: users can add new clients to the database and remove existing ones.
Viewing Client Information: displaying information about all bank clients on the screen.
Task Execution: two tasks - displaying information about the client with the highest current balance in the "Immediate" category and modifying a client's balance by depositing or withdrawing money.
This project is valuable for managing a bank's customer database. It provides essential tools for handling client information and executing tasks related to their current balances. With the capability to save and load data, the application ensures the preservation of information between sessions of usage.
